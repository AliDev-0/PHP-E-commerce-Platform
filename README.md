### üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

#### Prerequisites
- A local server environment such as [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) must be installed.
- Access to a database management tool like `phpMyAdmin`.

#### Installation Steps
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AliDev-0/PHP-E-commerce-Platform.git
    ```
2.  **Set up the database:**
    -   Create a new database in `phpMyAdmin` (e.g., `ecommerce_db`).
    -   Import the `web.sql` file into your newly created database. This will set up all the necessary tables and seed initial data.

3.  **Configure the connection:**
    -   Open the `config.php` file (or the relevant configuration file).
    -   Update the database credentials (host, username, password, and database name) to match your local setup.

4.  **Run the application:**
    -   Move the project folder into your server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
    -   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/PHP-E-commerce-Platform`.
